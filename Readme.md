The web page we’ll build advertises a mobile app which helps users record and share their experiences, so we’ll use video and landscape imagery to set the scene. A landing page is a vital tool in marketing a product these days, and the goal will be to entice potential customers into using the product.


This site will be built with: 

- Html
- css
- VScode 
- Git & Github

When the project is finished it will be published on GitHub Pages.
